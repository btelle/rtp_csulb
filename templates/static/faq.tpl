<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>How do I use website?</strong>
    <p>In order to use the website you will interact with parking area icons that
       are color coded in green, yellow, red, and grey overllayed on the CSULB
       campus map. These icons represent one of the over thirty parking areas on
       campus. When the mouse cursor is positioned over one of these icons you
       will see a small window that shows in detail of how many spaces that there
       are available to park in, and which kind of spaces they are.</p></li>
    <li><strong>What do the colors mean?</strong>
    <p>The colors of the parking area icons on the home page map show how full each
       of the areas are. If the color is red, the parking area is from 90% to 100%
       full.  If an icon is yellow, then the parking area is from 80% to 89% full.
       If an icon is green, then the parking area is less than 80% full. If an icon
       is grey, then the lot is closed for a special event such as a concert or
       sports game.
